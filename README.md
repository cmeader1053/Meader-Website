# Meader Website Project

## About

Welcome!

This project is centered around learning frontend/web design to build my own personal website to demonstrate my skill development.

If you're interested in learning frontend/website design skills, stay tuned as I continue to update this repo.

#### Areas of Focus

<ol>
<li>Learning HTML5 to build website structures</l1>
<li>Incorporating CSS3 to style/enhance website</l1>
<li>Integrating Javascript for website functionality</l1>
<li>Utilizing Git to push/pull my online Github repository to be able to work from anywhere and share my code<l1>
<li>Website hosting including acquiring a domain, storing content, reliable uptime, etc. </l1>
</ol>

`Note: There is no Javascript for the site just yet. Currently fine tuning the website foundations first before I introduce more complex code. `

#### Things to Consider

I'm learning as I go. This may seem basic to some experienced or professional developers but I am learning and doing it as I go.

What does this mean?

The coding principals will improve. The content will become more refined. My processes will become more polished.
